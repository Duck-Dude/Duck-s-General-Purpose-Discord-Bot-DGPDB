oh hi I never knew someone would really look at my discord bot

STATUS: unavailable, currently broken and im fixing it, currently working on installers                                      
this might not work on windows as it corrupted my hard drive and im not using it at all any more so I can't test it

well hi you might need to know how to use my discord bot
so node bot.js will start it
so to use the bot on termux you need to do                 
pkg install nodejs && npm install discord.js && node bot.js                    
so for the config.txt file you can do multiple bots with the form of a-token-I-guess,another-token-I-guess
if you just want one bot running just remove the comma (10 is the limit)
yeah thanks for using my bot :D
oh yeah message literally.baby.man.the.second if something broke or make a issue
this does come with JMusicBot 0.4.3 so yea

Tested on Lineage OS 20.0 (SM-T510), Android 11 (SM-T510), Android 13 (SM-S236DL) Windows 11 22H2 (22621, 4441), Kubuntu 24.10 (main pc), Node v22.8.0 (termux version) Node v18.16.0 (PC)

additional notes, this probally doesn't work on termux because something broke idk, currently working on an error system

I personally don't prefer using this on windows due to low resource availability but you can still use it.
